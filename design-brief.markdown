# Recpie Site Design Brief

## A brief summary of the business / site goals.
An exploration into design principles with a view to increasing knowledge of both design and user experience.

The site itself will be a place where it is easy to create a recipe including ingredients required and a photo.

Each recipe should be easy to read on mobile and tablet viewports. These are the devices it is assumed that a user is more likely to have in a kitchen.

## The key users.
Recipe creators: Users who are compelled to author and share a recipe. They should be able to author the recipe easily and quickly.

Recipe consumers: A user who is preparing the food described by the recipe will expect to be able to read the ingredients, view the picture and the instructions across many viewports. They will want to be able to focus on the ingredients and instructions.


## Scenarios in which your app or site will be used.
A recipe creator will contribute the photo, ingredients, instructions and keywords that represent the recipe.
Recipe consumers will search for a recipe by keywords and be presented with results. From here they can view each recipe in detail.

## Design style guidelines to follow.
Simple
Consistent
Invisible (the recipe is the content, not the website)
